The purpose was to write a program that can calculate the necessary vacation days. 
Certain days are not used as vacation days. 
In certain situations, the search parameters are incorrect


I completed the task in two hours. The time limit forced compromises in certain parts

1) There is almost no error handling. 

2) The error logging interface is missing

3) I used the "unknown" interface to search for public holidays. In real life, I would probably have a database for public holidays (user can edit)

4) Commenting is incomplete

5) The code structure could still be refined

6) Hardcoded parameters
